Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
Ans: Data structure is a particular way of storing and organizing information  in a computer  so that it can be
     retrieved and used most productively.

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
Ans: Compiler Design,
     Operating System,
     Database Management System,
     Statistical analysis package,
     Numerical Analysis,
     Graphics,
     Artificial Intelligence,
     Simulation


what is an Array?
Ans: An array, in the context of Java, is a dynamically-created object that serves as a container to hold constant
     number of values of the same type. By declaring an array, memory space is allocated for values of a particular
     type.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
Ans: 1. ArrayList can not contains primitive data types (like int , float , double) it can only contains Object while
        Array can contain both primitive data types as well as objects.
     2. Length of the ArrayList is provided by the size() method while Each array object has the length variable which
        returns the length of the array.
     3. Array can be multi dimensional , while ArrayList is always single dimensional.
     4. We can insert elements into the arraylist object using the add() method while  in array we insert elements
        using the assignment operator.

what is LinkedList?
Ans: A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object. Each element (we will call it
     a node) of a list is comprising of two items - the data and a reference to the next node. The last node has a
     reference to null. The entry point into a linked list is called the head of the list.

what is queue?
Ans: A Queue is a collection for holding elements prior to processing. Besides basic Collection operations, queues
     provide additional insertion, removal, and inspection operations.

what is stack?
Ans: A stack is a data structure that allows data to be inserted (a 'push' operation), and removed (a 'pop' operation).

what is FIFO and LIFO?
Ans:
what is the order of complexity?
Ans:
what is the best case to search an element from an array?
what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
what is tree in data structure?
what is graph in data structure?
what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
How HashMap works in java?
What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
Ans: ForLoop, ArraysCopyOf

What is difference between an array and a linked list?

What is DFS and BFS?
Ans: Breadth-first search is a tree traversal algorithm that visits the nodes of a tree level by level, increasing the

What is Recursion?

What is Big-(O)-notation?
Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
-  Bubble Sort:
    Advantages-
    The primary advantage of the bubble sort is that it is popular and easy to implement.
    The main disadvantage of the bubble sort is the fact that it does not deal well with a list containing a huge number of items.
    In the bubble sort, elements are swapped in place without using additional temporary storage.
     Disadvantages-
    The bubble sort requires n-squared processing steps for every n number of elements to be sorted.
    The space requirement is at a minimum
    The bubble sort is mostly suitable for academic teaching but not for real-life applications.


    Insertion Sort:
    Advantages-
    The main advantage of the insertion sort is its simplicity.
    The disadvantage of the insertion sort is that it does not perform as well as other, better sorting algorithms
    It also exhibits a good performance when dealing with a small list.
     Disadvantages-
    With n-squared steps required for every n element to be sorted, the insertion sort does not deal well with a huge list.
    The insertion sort is an in-place sorting algorithm so the space requirement is minimal.
    The insertion sort is particularly useful only when sorting a list of few items.

    Selection Sort:
    Advantages-
    The main advantage of the selection sort is that it performs well on a small list.
    The primary disadvantage of the selection sort is its poor efficiency when dealing with a huge list of items.
    Because it is an in-place sorting algorithm, no additional temporary storage is required beyond what is needed to hold the original list.
    Disadvantages-
    The selection sort requires n-squared number of steps for sorting n elements.
    Its performance is easily influenced by the initial ordering of the items before the sorting process.
    Quick Sort is much more efficient than selection sort

    Quick Sort:
    Advantages-
    The quick sort is regarded as the best sorting algorithm.
    The slight disadvantage of quick sort is that its worst-case performance is similar to average performances of the bubble, insertion or selections sorts.
    It is able to deal well with a huge list of items.
    Disadvantages-
    If the list is already sorted than bubble sort is much more efficient than quick sort
    Because it sorts in place, no additional storage is required as well
    If the sorting element is integers than radix sort is more efficient than quick sort.


    Heap sort:
    Advantages-
    The Heap sort algorithm is widely used because of its efficiency.
    Heap sort requires more space for sorting
    The Heap sort algorithm can be implemented as an in-place sorting algorithm
    Disadvantages-
    Quick sort is much more efficient than Heap in many cases
    its memory usage is minimal
    Heap sort make a tree of sorting elements.

    Merge Sort:

    Advantages-
    It can be applied to files of any size.
    Requires extra space Â»N
    Reading of the input during the run-creation step is sequential ==> Not much seeking.
    Disadvantages-
    Merge Sort requires more space than other sort.
    If heap sort is used for the in-memory part of the merge, its operation can be overlapped with I/O
    Merge sort is less efficient than other sort
